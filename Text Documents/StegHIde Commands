This command will embed the file secret.txt in the cover file picture.jpg.

picture.jpg to the person who should receive the secret message. The receiver
has to use steghide in the following way:

  $ steghide extract -sf picture.jpg
  Enter passphrase:
  wrote extracted data to "secret.txt".

secret.txt will be extracted from the stego file picture.jpg and saved
in the current directory.
