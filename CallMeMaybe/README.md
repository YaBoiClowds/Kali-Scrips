# Call Me Maybe
> Social Engineering Attack Suite for the Telephone Network (integrated with Plivo).

Disclaimer 1, this tool is only for use with numbers you are authorised to use. IANAL, check the laws and regulations in your local area.

Disclaimer 2, this is nothing brilliant, it's really a tool to interact with the Plivo API with a certain goal...

Disclaimer 3, this code is bad. I know.

The initial features this tool allows are: Spoofing Phone Calls, Spoofing SMS. Soon: Brute Force Dialling of Phone Number Ranges (to detect valid phone company numbers/extensions and record audio)

> There are two versions of the tool, neither written well (IANAD - I am not a dev)
> There is a ruby version for cli, and a cut-down python version that runs a web interface and supports the spoofing functions only (ideal for mobile access)
